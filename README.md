# nataliaswis
Simple project that is inspired by LinkTree. Personal site for TikTok, Instagram, YouTube creators.

This is real word working site. My first project published somewhere other than GitHub.
URL: https://nataliaswis.pl

This site contains links to social media accounts. That helps creator to promote their work. Social media platforms limits the numbers of links which lead beyond the platform. This is why sites like LinkTree are popular.
